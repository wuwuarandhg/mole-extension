# Built-in Tools

MoleClaw includes 37+ built-in tools covering all aspects of browser automation. The AI automatically selects the most suitable tools based on your natural language instructions.

## Page Awareness

| Tool | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `page_viewer` | Get the current page's visible text content for understanding page information |
| `page_snapshot` | Take a structured snapshot of the page, supports query-based element targeting, returns element tree and element_id |
| `page_skeleton` | Extract page skeleton structure for a quick overview of the overall layout |
| `page_assert` | Assert whether the page state meets expectations, used for verification after critical operations |
| `page_repair` | When page_assert fails, attempt to automatically repair the page state |
| `screenshot` | Take page screenshots — supports visible area, full page, region, and element screenshots (CDP enhanced) |
| `selection_context` | Get the text selected by the user on the page along with its surrounding context |

## Page Operations

| Tool | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `page_action` | Execute page interaction operations with two targeting modes: element_id (from page_snapshot, preferred) and CSS selector. Supports click, fill, scroll, scroll into view, hover, keypress, wait for element, get element info, etc. |
| `dom_manipulate` | Direct DOM manipulation: query elements, modify attributes, insert/remove nodes, etc. |
| `js_execute` | Execute custom JavaScript code in the page context for complex page interactions |

## Navigation & Tabs

| Tool | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `tab_navigate` | Tab navigation: navigate URL in current tab, open new tab, close tab, etc. |
| `fetch_url` | Make HTTP requests in the background to fetch URL content without affecting the current page |

## Browser Capabilities

| Tool | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `clipboard_ops` | Clipboard operations: read and write clipboard content |
| `storage_kv` | Key-value storage: read/write data in the extension's local storage, supports cross-session persistence |
| `notification` | Send browser desktop notifications |
| `bookmark_ops` | Bookmark operations: search, create, delete bookmarks |
| `history_search` | Search browser history |
| `download_file` | Download files to local disk |

## Timers & Automation

| Tool | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `timer` | Unified timer management: set delayed tasks, recurring tasks, clear timers, and list active timers |
| `resident_runtime` | Resident runner: continuously run tasks in the background, suitable for long-term monitoring or periodic execution |

## Workflows & Tasks

| Tool | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `site_workflow` | Execute predefined site workflows, automatically matches available workflows based on the current page URL |
| `spawn_subtask` | Split independent sub-goals into isolated tasks, each with its own context |
| `request_confirmation` | Request user confirmation before performing sensitive or irreversible actions. The user sees the message and can approve or reject with an optional reason |
| `ask_user` | Ask the user a question to gather missing information or let them choose between options. Supports preset options and/or free text input |
| `save_workflow` | Save a user-confirmed workflow definition to the registry, used in the dialog-based recording confirmation flow |

## CDP Enhanced Tools <Badge type="tip" text="Chrome DevTools Protocol" />

Connected to Chrome DevTools Protocol via the `chrome.debugger` API, providing browser-process-level deep control. These tools are especially critical when regular Content Script approaches are limited (anti-bot detection, cross-origin iframes, network details, etc.).

### Input & Interaction

| Tool | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `cdp_input` | Send trusted mouse/keyboard events (`isTrusted=true`): click, double-click, right-click, hover, drag, type text, keypress, scroll. Bypasses anti-bot event source detection |
| `cdp_dialog` | Query and handle JavaScript dialogs (alert/confirm/prompt/beforeunload), supports manual handling and auto strategies |

### Pages & Frames

| Tool | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `cdp_frame` | Cross-iframe operations: list all page frames, execute JS in a specific frame, get iframe text snapshot. Solves cross-origin iframe issues (CAPTCHAs, payment forms, etc.) |

### Network & Cookies

| Tool | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `cdp_network` | CDP-enhanced network monitoring: complete request/response data (including body and headers), statistical summaries, and cross-origin Cookie read/write (get/set/delete) |

### Environment Emulation

| Tool | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `cdp_emulation` | Device and environment emulation: viewport size (mobile), User-Agent override, geolocation spoofing, language/timezone settings, network condition simulation (3G/offline, etc.) |

### Request Interception

| Tool | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `cdp_fetch` | Request interception and modification (Fetch domain): intercept page network requests to modify and continue, return custom responses (Mock API), or simulate failures. Useful for auth header injection, data mocking, and CORS bypass |

### Deep DOM Operations

| Tool | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `cdp_dom` | Cross-origin DOM operations (DOM domain): query/modify DOM nodes via CDP, ignoring same-origin policy. Supports CSS selector queries, HTML read/write, attribute operations, precise element box model (margin/border/padding/content), and node removal |

### Page Storage

| Tool | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `cdp_storage` | Page storage operations (DOMStorage domain): read/write the target page's localStorage and sessionStorage without content scripts. Useful for reading login tokens, modifying cache configs, and clearing storage data |

### Style Operations

| Tool | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `cdp_css` | CSS style inspection and modification (CSS domain): get computed styles and matching CSS rules, modify inline styles, dynamically add CSS rules, read/write complete stylesheets. Useful for style diagnostics, dynamic CSS injection, and design token extraction |

### Visual Highlighting

| Tool | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `cdp_overlay` | Element highlighting (Overlay domain): highlight specified DOM nodes, elements matching CSS selectors, or rectangular regions with custom colors. Visually marks AI operation targets so users can observe what's being operated on |

### Debug & Diagnostics

| Tool | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `cdp_console` | Capture page console.log/warn/error output and uncaught JavaScript exceptions to help AI diagnose page issues |

::: warning Note
CDP tools require the `debugger` permission. A debugger notification bar will appear at the top of the browser during use — this is Chrome's security mechanism and is expected behavior.

## Tool Selection Priority

When the AI needs to operate on a page, it selects tools in this priority order:

1. **`site_workflow`** — Preferred: use predefined workflows when available for the current page, fast and reliable
2. **`page_snapshot`** + `page_action(element_id=...)` — Snapshot to locate elements, then operate precisely by element_id
3. **`page_action(selector=...)`** — CSS selector-based operations when element_id is unavailable
4. **`cdp_input`** — When anti-bot detection blocks regular clicks, use CDP to send trusted events
5. **`dom_manipulate`** — Direct DOM manipulation as a last resort

::: tip
You don't need to manually choose tools — just describe your needs in natural language, and the AI will automatically select the best tool combination for the task.
